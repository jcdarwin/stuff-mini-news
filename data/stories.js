Then he has to go through the playing side and make sure we pick him.&quot;</p> <p>An Australian Rugby Union spokesman said Quade had still not completed his citizenship application.</p> <p>&quot;The wheels are in motion for&nbsp;Quade&nbsp;to secure his Australian passport. There is no timeframe on the process but we're not anticipating any obstacles.&quot;</p> <p>In case he was contemplating switching allegiances again, New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens said the door was firmly shut on Cooper turning out for the All Black Sevens.</p> <p>&quot;He's a quality rugby player, he's been very passionate about playing for the Wallabies and I expect him to pass the citizenship test and line up in Rio.</p> <p>&quot;It would be unheard of for someone to play for the Wallabies in fifteens and then New Zealand in the sevens. It wouldn't sit right.&quot;</p> <p>According to figures from Australia's Department&nbsp;of&nbsp;Immigration&nbsp;and Border Protection, more than 650,000 people have taken the&nbsp; computer-based citizenship test since 2007, answering questions on subjects ranging from Australian values to its political system.</p> <p>A little more than 7200 (1.1 per cent) failed.</p> <p>The government says the test ensures applicants have&nbsp;a basic knowledge of the English language,&nbsp;an adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and&nbsp;an understanding of the nature of their application.</p> <div> &nbsp; </div> <iframe src=\"http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/56c54932b6c51fb652e63588\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"437\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

"alt_intro":"How do cancer rates differ across New Zealand? These are the numbers that tell a startling story.",
"body":"<p>Kiwis in New Zealand's cancer hotspots die at up to three times the rate of those in low-cancer regions, new figures reveal.</p> <p>The statistics, obtained by <i>Stuff</i>, showed Northlanders were 1.3 times more likely to die of cancer than Kiwis living in Waitemata. That means for every 100,000 Northlanders, there are 33 extra cancer deaths.</p> <p>But the regional variation for some of the &quot;big four&quot; killer cancers - lung, breast, prostate and bowel - was much higher. Men in Northland died of prostate cancer at almost three times the rate of men in Waitemata, while more southern New Zealanders died of bowel cancer.</p> <p>The figures, from 2010-2012, also showed Kiwis living close to big cities generally had lower death rates than those in rural New Zealand.</p> <p><b>READ MORE<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/77017703/why-do-northland-men-die-of-prostate-cancer-at-such-high-rates.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping New Zealand's prostate cancer rates</a><br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/77001156/why-are-so-many-southern-new-zealanders-dying-of-bowel-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why are so many southern New Zealanders dying of bowel cancer?</a><br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76994699/where-are-more-kiwi-women-dying-of-breast-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Where are more Kiwi women dying of breast cancer?</a><br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76990694/lung-cancer--which-parts-of-new-zealand-can-breathe-easy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lung cancer - which parts of New Zealand can breathe easy?</a><br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76795869/where-are-our-national-cancer-hotspots.html\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding our national cancer hotspots</a></b></p> <p>Otago University cancer researcher Diana Sarfati said the regional variations were probably driven more by differences in population makeup and risk factors such as smoking, than radical treatment differences. For example, Maori are more likely to die of cancer, partly because they tend to be diagnosed later.</p> <p>However, the rural-urban divide suggested there could be genuine treatment disparities caused by delayed access to specialists, a tendency to favour locally-provided treatments, or worse outcomes from having highly specialised treatments delivered by generalist doctors.&nbsp;New Zealand should collect more detailed data to disentangle possible causes, she said.</p> <p>&quot;We have to separate the things we can do something about from the things we can't.&quot;</p> <p>Northland DHB put its high death rates down to a poorer population with more Maori, but said it was trying to bridge the ethnic gap. A new $5 million cancer centre would broaden the treatments available locally.</p> <p>Medical Association chairman Stephen Child said simply dismissing higher death rates as being due to population differences was not acceptable.</p> <p>&quot;It's not good enough that there's three times the mortality in one area, so why is that? You're probably not going to find a single thing that changes mortality. But you want to see that gap getting smaller.&quot;</p> <p>Otago University cancer epidemiology unit director Brian Cox said a three-fold variation in death rates was worrying, but could provide clues to how a cancer worked. He also called for more detailed data, which he said New Zealand had been remiss in failing to collect.</p> <p>&quot;It's differences that help you understand what the hell is going on, so it's important that differences are explored.&quot;</p> <p>Health Ministry cancer clinical director Andrew Simpson said the ministry's new tumour standards should ensure a bowel cancer patient in Cromwell could access exactly the same care as a bowel cancer patient in Auckland. The standards provide clear diagnosis and treatment expectations and health boards have to report against them.</p> <p>The Ministry has also introduced faster cancer treatment waiting targets. However, no DHB has yet met the targets, with only half of all patients being seen in time in the West Coast, Tairawhiti and Whanganui.</p> <p><b>KEY FINDINGS</b></p> <p>For all cancers, those in cancer hotspots died at 1.3 times the rate of those in low-cancer areas.</p> <p>Prostate cancer varied most, with Northland men dying at three times the Waitemata rate.</p> <p>Rural Kiwis did worse than urban Kiwis. Waitemata, Nelson Marlborough, Capital and Coast, Auckland and Canterbury DHBs had the lowest death rates, while Northland, Tairawhiti, Lakes, Wairarapa and Taranaki had the highest.</p> <p>Cancer deaths were mostly highest in populations with high deprivation and more Maori, but bowel cancer deaths were concentrated in white, wealthy southern regions.</p> <p><i>*Cancer death rate maps show areas with rates significantly higher or lower than the national rate, calculated using the Keyfitz method.</i></p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://andyfyers.cartodb.com/viz/4aa6052e-d6af-11e5-8a74-0ea31932ec1d/embed_map\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe><script id=\"infogram_0_cancer_death_rates_by_dhb\" title=\"cancer death rates by DHB\" src=\"http://e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?A38\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://andyfyers.cartodb.com/viz/7763c71e-d6b8-11e5-81a7-0ecd1babdde5/embed_map\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>",

"alt_intro":"After more than a decade, an historic house is back on the market, but the rundown villa will be a big task for whoever takes her on.",
"body":"<p>An historic Nelson house that was threatened with removal from its prime Port Hills site is back on the market.</p> <p>It's unknown why American-based owner Robert Johnson has listed the property he bought in 2000.</p> <p>He created a public uproar in 2004 when it was revealed he planned to move the then 100-year-old villa off its Whitby Rd site and replace it with a five-storey apartment building.</p> <p>His plans were stymied by opposition from the public and the building's group A heritage rating with the Nelson City Council,&nbsp;which means it is protected from demolition or removal and a resource consent is needed to make alterations to the property.</p> <p>The house is now in a state of disrepair with paint flaking off the weatherboards, tape covering holes in the windows and broken spouting visible from the road. It will be a substantial restoration project for the new owners.&nbsp;</p> <p>Property information obtained from QV.co.nz shows the house was purchased in February 2000 for $350,000&nbsp;and it appears little has been done to maintain it since.</p> <p>Described on the Harcourts website as the &quot;ultimate doer-upper&quot; the five-bedroom, two-bathroom Victorian villa is situated on a&nbsp;2125 square metre section and&nbsp;has views out across the Nelson harbour entrance and Haulashore Island.&nbsp;</p> <p>Harcourts declined to comment about the listing and why the owner had decided to sell when contacted.&nbsp;</p> <p>The house was built in 1904 for the son of&nbsp;the Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company founder, Alexander Brown. A stained glass window above the front door bears the name &quot;Rutherglen&quot; after Brown's birthplace near Glasgow, Scotland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information from the Nelson City Council, as at September 2015,&nbsp;shows the property has a capital value of $720,000, made up of a land value of $690,000 and an improvements value of $30,000.</p> <p>Bruce McGregor has lived at Rutherglen for the last four years. He jumped at the chance to live in the grand old house despite its rundown appearance when a friend mentioned it was up for rent. &nbsp;</p> <p>McGregor, a British musician, previously worked in the property industry refurbishing old houses of a similar era. He said he would have loved to buy the house and restore it himself but short of winning the lottery, he was happy to settle with living in it as it was.</p> <p>&quot;It's one of those things, just wanted it to be mine for awhile,&quot; he said. &quot;It's such a shame to see her literally crumbling ... it's been a real struggle to be told you can't do anything.&quot;</p> <p>Despite its rundown appearance, he said the house was structurally solid.</p> <p>&quot;The bones are fine, she is not going to fall down any time soon, she just needs a heck of a lot of money to restore her again.&quot;</p> <p>He said the house was in need of a new roof, floor, electrical wiring and plumbing. Despite having rented it for four years, McGregor didn't live in the house through the winter because it was bitterly cold inside.</p> <p>&quot;She leaks, she smells and all the rest of it but she is just beautiful,&quot; he said. &quot;She is a grand old house, she has that element of grandeur.&quot;</p> <p>McGregor's favourite part of the house was the view from his bedroom window and the pillared balcony on the first floor, on which hours could be spent looking out across Tasman Bay.</p> <p>&quot;We call it the Bermuda balcony because you get lost there,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He said Rutherglen was a family home that had been built for entertaining and his two children had loved living there.</p> <p>&quot;There has been no love shown to the house at all in the last 16 years,&quot; he said. &quot;We have been loving her from the inside out.&quot;</p> <p>McGregor said the sale of the house was bittersweet, he was sad at the thought of no longer living there but pleased at the thought of it going to someone willing to restore it.</p> <p>&quot;It is quite an emotive issue for me, she is a beautiful old girl.&quot;</p> <p>Rutherglen also has a&nbsp;category two Heritage New Zealand&nbsp;rating, which means it is classified as a &quot;place of historical or cultural heritage significance or value&quot;.</p> <p>Heritage New Zealand advisor Alison Dangerfield said the organisation was excited at the prospect of the building being conserved and they were looking forward to working with a new owner.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The house has obviously had limited maintenance over the last 10 years but its values are high and it has a great significance to the local area and in the development of Nelson,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's held on for a long time and that is what timber buildings can do to a extent until an owner who values the heritage of the building can conserve its fabric.&quot;</p> <p>A neighbour with experience restoring a heritage-listed house was confident Rutherglen could be saved despite its rundown appearance.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said there were several options for restoring the house and given its size it could be reinstated as a family residence or developed into luxury apartments.</p> <p>The house was an iconic fixture in Nelson and he estimated it would cost in excess of $1 million to restore.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's a big one for Nelson because we have lost so much,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope someone with a master plan for restoring some of the historical fabric takes it on.&quot;</p> <p>Nelson Historic Society president Ken Wright said the society also agreed that Rutherglen house was worth saving.</p> <p>&quot;From our point of view we are pleased to see it is on the market and we live in hope that someone who purchases it wishes to care for it,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;A lot of those older homes do require a lot of work to keep them maintained, so it is a bit of a commitment for whoever buys it.&quot;</p> <p>Despite being heritage listed, there was no insistence the house was maintained, just an expectation the owners looked after it as best they could.</p>",
